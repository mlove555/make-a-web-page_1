      The coder uses HTML to instruct the computer processor to create a change such as bold or italic to specific elements in the text, they must also tell the computer when to stop taking this action.

                for two reasons, the first is the user may be able to find the link on their own and more importantly it addresses the requirements of Universal Design, which ask the programmer to anticipate the needs of visually impaired web cruisers

          <p>
            White Space is an essential element for making webpages easy on the viewer. When content is displayed with gaps for the eye to rest on the viewer can interact more efficiently in the non-print based medium of the World-Wide-Web.
            <br>
            <br> Web pages are more likely to be read, enjoyed and revisited if the viewer is not <em>slammed</em> by a wall of words.
            <br>
            <br> Web cruisers are not going to give a page any more attention than they need too. White space engages them by providing a quick visual means to scan for content that is interesting to them.

            <em>For Italics (emphasis) the code looks like:</em> &lt;em&gt; I am italic &lt;/em &gt;

            <br>
          </div>
        </div>
        <div>Recall that the open commands are &lt;b&gt; and &lt;em&gt; and the required closing command needs a forward slash, &lt;/b&gt; and &lt;/em&gt;.<em>
    <br><br>
    The processor will not stop doing any instruction you start until you tell it to stop doing so.</em>

          <br>
        </div>
        <div>
          <p><em>The code looks like:</em> &lt;a href="www.linkyouwant.com"&gt;<em>clickable name</em>&lt;/a&gt;
            <br> The viewer sees a clickable link <a href=""><em>clickable name</em></a>

        <div><b>Third: Inserting an Image</b>

        </div>
        <div><em>The code looks like:</em> &lt;img src=”url” alt=”text description”&gt;
          <br>The viewer sees the picture (jpeg that you want seen)
        </div>
        <br>
        <div>Notice that there is no &lt;/img&gt; this is because inserting pictures falls into the category of void tags. These are tags that complete a task with one instruction, (insert an image or a white space) doing so without interrupting original coding
          structure. The alt element in this tag is important and should not be ignored as it provides the viewer with information about the image when a link is broken or the viewer cannot see it. Web designers must create alternate <em>(hence alt=)</em>          resources to address Universal Design for Learning (UDL) principles. UDL allows for even the visually impaired to interact successfully with the world-wide-web.

        </div>
        <div>
          <ul>
            <li>&lt;br&gt; is a void tag (does not need a closing tag) along with being an inline tag</li>
            <li>&lt;p&gt;block&lt;/p&gt; is a block tag which creates a container for larger amounts of content. It will stretch to contain anything placed within the opening and closing commands while providing a border of whitespace around the content</li>
          </ul>

        <div>
          <p>
            <b>id vs class</b>
            <br>
            <br>
            <b>id</b> is a unique identifier for any element on the entire page and must be used only once and it looks like
            <br>&lt;div id="<em>the only one</em>">&gt;
            <br>
            <br>When the anchor tag &lt;a href="<em>#the only one</em>"&gt; text &lt;/a&gt; is used it provides an internal navigation link to content within the website.
            <br>
            <br>
            <b>class</b> applies a similar style to groups of elements allowing coding to be placed in the CSS file, reducing repetition.
            <br><em>The coder must decide how many branches are needed and describe expectations using class names</em>
            <br>The code looks like &lt;div class="<em>descriptive name</em>"&gt;
            <br>

        </div>
        <div>
          <ul>
            <li>Understand the when the programmer starts something they must also stop it</li>
            <li>Void commands do not require a stop command</li>
            <li>Commands may be inline or block, spaces or containers</li>
            <li>Without HTML the viewer will encounter a wall of words and jump over your site</li>
          </ul>
          <br>
          <br>
        </div>
        <div>
          <p>There are some <em>elements</em> in HTML code that do not have to be closed after being opened, these are void elements. Two that are used by emerging programmers are break &lt;br&gt; and image &lt;img scr=”url” alt=”text”&gt;. With &lt;br&gt;
            a blank space is added and the action is done. This is also true for &lt;img…..&gt; which inserts a picture and once done there is no further action to take.

          <p>Fortunately the world-wide-web leads us to a wealth of information. We no longer have to keep tedious notes or memorizes vast volumes of coding information all we need to do is ask (I like to search using Google). There are many resources for
            <a href=http://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_code.asp target="_blank">finding code</a> and even sites where an individual can use an <a href=http://www.html.am/html-editors/online-html-editor.cfm target="_blank">editor</a> to create what they
            want to see and then switch to HTML view where they can copy the code they need and then paste it into the HTML they are working on.

              <div class="comments">
                In order to create structure for a web page the coder needs to:

                  <li>Have some idea of what they want their content to look like.</li>
                  <li>Identify the layers/parts as boxes, and boxes inside of boxes.</li>
                  <li>Nest <b>div</b> tags inside of each other to reflect the structure of the boxes inside of boxes</li>
                  <li>Assign relevant class names in the div tag.

            Cascading Style Sheet (CSS) is code that adds color and shapes to HTML is a uniform, succinct, efficient manner. On this web page if I want to change the color on <b>all</b> of the lighter blue headings I only have to change <b>one</b> element
            in the CSS.
            <br>
            <br> CSS searches HTML for selectors, class names, or ids applying the assigned style information to the div containers. By coding style in the CSS repetition is avoided in HTML.

            <p>HTML creates content and controls the structure of a web page while CSS, <em>Cascading Style Sheet</em>, adds style. CSS reduces the amount of repetitive code required by setting a style configuration. Using these two tools creates a structure
              for code that makes a web page more interesting for the viewer and understandable for Front End Development sharing. The process, DOM, <em>Document Object Model</em>, refers to the branching structure that HTML coding looks like while cascading
              implies that the style will be applied to all subsequent branches unless a more specific rule is defined along the way.

              This excellent link to <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/css/css_boxmodel.asp " target="_blank">HTML boxes</a> explains elements in the CSS code above, such as padding, border and margins. Keep in mind that div is always a rectangular block
              that extends the full width of the webpage unless CSS tells it to do something different. For instance the rounded edges on the large boxes on this page come from the CSS declaration <em>border-radius: 15px;</em>

          <div>
            <p>
              <b>What</b> is repetition? Repetition is occurring when you find yourself getting the great idea to copy code and paste it multiple times throughout your HTML. If you are doing this and not altering some element in the tag such as <em>class</em>              or <em>id</em> then you are repeating yourself.
              <br>
              <br>
              <b>Why</b> should it be avoided? Imagine that you have copied and pasted code for about the last fifty minutes in at least 73 places, now imagine that you are reviewing your work and you notice that something does not look quite right in
              a few places, as you dig deeper you realize that the same error is occurring in all of the places that you have just pasted copied code into. This means that you will now have to go back and find all of the places in your code where this
              problem exists and fix them. <em>"ARRGGHHH"</em>, time wasted and badly.
              <br>
              <br> If wasting time doesn't bother you think about a scenario in which you simply cannot figure out what is wrong with your code. You may have to ask someone for help. Now, your mom might sit down and draw lines from one tag to another while
              you clean her house and three days later find the answer, but do you have time for this. If your code is a mess of repetition no one else is going to look at your work.
              <br>
              <br> Another problem with repetition is that if you need to make a change, or maintain your code to address updates, the action must be done in every single individual instance that it occurs within the HTML code. Another time vacuum.
              <br>
              <br>
              <b>How</b> not to repeat yourself. Avoiding repetition means being alert as you code, if you find yourself coding any element or tag exactly like another try to think of a way to identify that action. Assign a class or heading to the action
              and describe what you want done in the CSS element. This means that if you realize you don't like something about the element you need only make the change in your CSS code one time and the computer will take care of finding the other 72
              places you assigned that value.
              <br>
              <br>
              <em>Avoiding repetition helps anyone following your code or trying to help you with coding issues  because it keeps your logic simple to understand, maintainable and exhibits industry standards for best practices.</em>
